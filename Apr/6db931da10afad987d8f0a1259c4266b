Hey, what’s up? I’m Gustavo Arellano, the host of a daily news podcast that will bring you the world through the eyes of the West Coast. It’s called “The Times: Daily news from the L.A. Times.” Expect award-winning reporting, hard-hitting investigations and random randomness from the biggest newspaper west of the Mississippi right to your ears. Whether it’s farmworkers, Silicon Valley, Hollywood or car chases, we’ll give you deep dives and snippets, rants and discourse, laughers and weepers, with a diversity of voices and a bunch of drama and desmadre. So join me every weekday with “The Times: Daily news from the L.A. Times.” Our first episode premieres May 3.
