One thing I love about this recipe is that it’s as easy to make for  four people as it is to make for one. It’s not really a recipe as much as it is a method. While the bacon is baking, you can scramble the eggs and get the tortillas and cheese ready to go so once the bacon is out, you just have a few more minutes of broiling until dinner is ready. If it’s just me, I’ll  cook the bacon in the microwave. Just place however many slices you want between a couple layers of paper towel. Microwave on high until crisp, about  four minutes.
