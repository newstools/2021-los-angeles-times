A new blanket of snow fell on many Southern California mountains Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, adding 5 inches to the slopes at Big Bear’s winter resorts. The National Weather Service said there was a 40% chance of more precipitation Wednesday in Big Bear, with more snow possible Friday, Saturday, Sunday and early next week. The NWS has issued a high wind warning, saying gusts could reach 70 mph in parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Officials at Big Bear Mountain Resort said lift tickets for daytime skiing on Saturday are already sold out, but night skiing remains open. The slopes in the Big Bear area have a base depth of 36 to 48 inches of snow. At Mountain High in Wrightwood, which had 3 inches of fresh powder Wednesday morning, base depth is 18 inches. Before you head for the mountains, know that state officials forbid overnight leisure travel stays, whether in hotels or short-term rentals. They also urge against trips of more than 120 miles. The Angeles Crest Highway, gateway to many San Gabriel Mountains destinations, is closed in multiple spots for wildfire cleanup. Mt. Waterman, a small, ski area along that highway, remains closed.  Before any winter mountain trip, check weather conditions and/or make sure you have chains in the car. Also, as part of COVID-19 prevention measures, these resorts all require advance reservations for lift tickets. The following winter resorts are within 100 miles of L.A.
